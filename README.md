A game about a scientist losing his mind in a lonely world surrounded by robots.

## ⚠️ Warning
This game is made using [a custom build of Godot 4 with .NET6](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64089), so you will need to suffer a bit to get the game working (if you want to).

## ❓ QA
Q: Why C#? GDScript is far more superior and has more support!

A: Because I like C# more I guess. I used GDScript but I am not a fan of its syntax.
